CONNECTION & DISCOVER APP - QUICK DEVELOPMENT HELP
=====================================================

GETTING STARTED
---------------
1. Create new repository: "Connection-App" (or your preferred name)
2. Copy all files into repository folder
3. Add your Firebase config to config.js (optional for now)
4. Open index.html in browser to test locally
5. Use GitHub Desktop to commit/push changes
6. Enable GitHub Pages for auto-deployment

LOCAL TESTING
-------------
- Open index.html directly in browser
- Use multiple tabs to test multiplayer interaction
- Test different relationship types and question flows
- Check mobile responsiveness with browser dev tools
- Use console (F12) to debug any issues

DEVELOPMENT COMMANDS
-------------------
- Edit files → Save → Refresh browser (instant testing)
- GitHub Desktop: Commit → Push → Live in 2-3 minutes
- Test locally first, then deploy to live

COMMON DEVELOPMENT TASKS
------------------------

Add New Relationship Type:
1. Add button in index.html relationship-screen section
2. Add case in questions.js relationship mapping arrays
3. Test that appropriate questions load

Add New Questions:
1. Edit questions.js
2. Find correct Round → Category → Relationship Type
3. Add questions to appropriate array
4. Test with that relationship type

Modify Categories:
1. Edit roundConfigs in script.js
2. Update corresponding sections in questions.js
3. Test category display and question loading

Change Styling:
1. Edit styles.css
2. Maintain glassmorphism aesthetic
3. Test on mobile and desktop

DEBUGGING TIPS
--------------
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Use console.log() in script.js for debugging
- Test each relationship type individually
- Verify questions load for all categories
- Check mobile responsive breakpoints

FILE EDIT FREQUENCY
-------------------
Most Common Edits:
- questions.js (adding new questions)
- styles.css (styling adjustments)
- script.js (functionality changes)

Rare Edits:
- index.html (structural changes)
- config.js (only for Firebase setup)

TESTING CHECKLIST
------------------
Before Committing:
□ All relationship types work
□ All categories show questions
□ Turn switching functions
□ Round progression works
□ Mobile responsive
□ No console errors
□ Game completes properly

Quick Test Sequence:
1. Pick any relationship type
2. Enter player names
3. Play through one complete round
4. Check question quality and appropriateness
5. Test on mobile view

FIREBASE SETUP (FUTURE)
-----------------------
When ready for multiplayer:
1. Create Firebase project
2. Enable Realtime Database
3. Update config.js with your credentials
4. Uncomment Firebase import lines
5. Add multiplayer sync logic

GITHUB PAGES SETUP
------------------
1. Repository Settings → Pages
2. Source: Deploy from branch
3. Branch: main (or master)
4. Folder: / (root)
5. Save → Live URL provided

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
------------------------
- Images: Use WebP format, compress
- CSS: Minimize unused styles
- JS: Remove console.logs before production
- Test loading speed on slower connections

COMMON ISSUES
-------------
Issue: Questions not showing
Fix: Check relationship type mapping in questions.js

Issue: Styling broken on mobile
Fix: Check CSS media queries and viewport meta tag

Issue: Firebase errors
Fix: Verify config.js credentials and database rules

Issue: GitHub Pages not updating
Fix: Clear browser cache, check repository settings

BACKUP STRATEGY
---------------
- GitHub automatically backs up code
- Download repository zip occasionally
- Test major changes on separate branch first

COLLABORATION
-------------
- Use clear commit messages
- Test before pushing to main branch
- Document any breaking changes
- Keep PROJECT_INFO.txt updated

This workflow maintains the same development pattern as your Dating-App for comfortable iteration and testing.
